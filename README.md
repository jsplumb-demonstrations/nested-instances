## Nested Instances

This demonstration shows nested instances of JsPlumb being rendered into the nodes of some top level instance.

The code implements a simple desktop app. Windows can be dragged around, minimised, restored and resized.

The windows in this demo show a cut down version of the [Flowchart builder demonstration](https://github.com/jsplumb-demonstrations/flowchart-builder) and the [Hello world demonstration](https://github.com/jsplumb-demonstrations/hello-world).

In the initial push of this repository we've only provided an ES6 version. If you're using an integration and you're interested in a version of this for your library, get in touch.
